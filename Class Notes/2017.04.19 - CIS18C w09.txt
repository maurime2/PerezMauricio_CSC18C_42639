					Push O(1)	-->	Pushes an element on to the top of the stack.
					Pop	 O(1)	-->	Pops the top element off the stack.
					Peak O(1)	-->	Looks at top element on stack. 
								Just returns top element of stack.
								And leaves it there.
								
			Other Utility Functions:
					isEmpty	O(1)	-->	Returns true if stack is empty.
										Otherwise returns false if elements 
										present.
								
					display O(n)	-->	Outputs contents of stack from top to 
										bottom.

				Vector could be like a bag.
