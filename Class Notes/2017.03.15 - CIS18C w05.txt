Bag/Collection Assignment Tip
If you find yourself having issues with comparing two items of type T with
 the compareTo method, you will want to change your class header to:

public final class Bag<T extends Object & Comparable<? super T> > implements BagInterface {

Remember, the type T must be a class, cannot be the primitive types.
