Download the following Netbeans Project with the Bag/Collection project. Implement the sort function to sort from smallest to largest values with either Quick Sort, or Merge Sort. (If you want to be daring and bold, I will offer 2 points extra credit if you implement the sort function with Heap Sort).

This assignment is due before 11:59PM on 3/24/2017. The Early Bird Bonus will apply for submission submitted before 11:59PM on 3/19/2017.

Hint: when working with generic template classes (we will do this all through the course), you will need to use: import java.util.Comparator;
and also use in any functions/methods that compare two items of the generic type with: <T extends Comparable<T>>
This will allow you to use the compareTo method which is used to compare two objects.

Example of using compareTo for strings: java-string-compareto-method-example
Sometimes, when we write our own classes that may not have a concrete way of comparing two objects of the class, we have to implement our own compareTo method
Even though this last link is not required for the assignment, it is something to think about.
