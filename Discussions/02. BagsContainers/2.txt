In your own words, propose a way that we could modify our 
Bag/Container to become a sorted Bag/Container 
in which when we add a new item, 
the item is added to the Bag/Container.

The way im most comfortable with is to add a temporary array, dump all the elements of the bag within, traverse the array with any prefered sorting method, sort, delete the previous bag, re create the bag with the new sorted array elements...
