In your own words, 
propose how we could improve the 
remove method in our Bag/Container class.


I think I'm over thinking this question too much. I don't see how to improve the remove method, seeing as how﻿﻿ you have to traverse each element after the element you are removing.
What you can do is sort the bag to then implement a search for the element in question, but even then, I still think you somehow have to traverse through the whole bag when deleting and shifting the bag down one elelemnt.
I am not sure...
